  sbx is a small shell script that provides a minimal CLI
  interface to simplify the manual process of building
  SlackBuilds.org packages on Slackware, namely:

    1. Download distfiles
    2. Check the md5sums
    3. Run the .SlackBuild script
    4. Install the built package

  It also provides additional features such as querying available
  packages and checking for updates with installed SBo packages.

  For more information, see its man page:

    man 8 sbx
